# Portfolio Website

- <a href="https://mzafarm.github.io/portfolio/">Website Link</a>ðŸ”—

My portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript. Nothing too fancy, just a place where I showcase my work and talk a bit about myself.

# Things I learned

- HTML, CSS, JS
- The need for Typescript
- The levenshtein Distance algorithm

## Got Any Suggestions?

If you think something could be improved or if you spot a bug, feel free to send over a pull request or open an issue. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio's repo!
