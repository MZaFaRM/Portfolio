# Portfolio Website

- <a href="https://mzafarm.github.io/Portfolio/">Website Link</a>ðŸ”—

This is a simple portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Nothing too fancy, just a place where I showcase my work and talk a bit about myself.

## What's in Here

Literally just my portfolio

## Got Any Suggestions?

If you think something could be improved or if you spot a bug, feel free to send over a pull request or open an issue. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration, especially since this isn't the finished project.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio's repo!
