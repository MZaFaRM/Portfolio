This is a simple portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Nothing too fancy, just a place where I showcase my work and talk a bit about myself, and do note that it's still a work in progress.

## What's in Here

- **Command-Line Interface Style**: The site has a CLI-style interface. Type in commands to see different parts of the portfolio.
- **Projects Display**: You'll find some of my coding projects here â€“ from little games to some AI stuff.
- **About Me Section**: There's a bit about my journey in coding and what I like to work on.
