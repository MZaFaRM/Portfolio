My portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript. Nothing too fancy, just a place where I showcase my work and talk a bit about myself.

# Things I learned

- HTML, CSS, JS
- The need for Typescript
- The levenshtein Distance algorithm

## Got Any Suggestions?

Thanks for checking out my portfolio's repo!
