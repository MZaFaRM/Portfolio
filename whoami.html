    Hey, I'm Muhammed Zafar, navigating my way through a B. Tech in Computer
    Science and Engineering 🎓. I am quite interested in AI and Machine Learning
    🤖, and is trying my best to learn more about them!
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not in the classroom, I juggle freelance gigs and internships in
    web development 💻. I also immerse myself in our college communities,
    notably
    <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/MZaFaRM">μlearn</a>
    and
    <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/MZaFaRM">IEDC</a>, cherishing
    every chance to learn and grow 🌱.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aesthetics of this portfolio is my fondness for terminal-based
    interfaces 🖥️ which i consider to be a tribute to minimalism and
    functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the learning front, I'm currently going through CS50AI 📚 and delving
    into 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow. Though, I'd love a book or course
    recommendation! 📖
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond code, I play chess ♟️, complete puzzles 🧩, feed my wanderlust 🌍,
    and play a lot of games 🎮, especially the Arkham Series. Fancy a game or
    two? lemme know! 📩
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, if you have got an idea for an AI project, lemme know, I'm all ears!
    ✨.
