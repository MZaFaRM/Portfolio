      &emsp;When I was doing the tedious task of populating databases for
      testing an API I wrote, I thought, "There's got to be a better way!" And
      that's how <strong>DataForge</strong> came to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;It's a Python tool I built to auto-generate and insert realistic
      test data into databases. What's cool about it is how it figures out those
      foreign key relations to order those tables to fill first. I've had a
      great time making data insertion a breeze with this project! Hope you find
      it helpful too.

      &emsp;This is literally one of the first actual project I made, and a lot
      of my friends seemed to have liked it, which motivated me to create more
      other better projects, although right now I am not really fond of some of
      the design choices I made in the project. But back then I was really proud
      of it, I remember sitting on it for hours after college.

      of that algorithm to crush a lot of games, hope you like it.

    <p>
      &emsp;After TicTacToeAI, I wanted to take a step further. So, I built
      <strong>MinesweeperAI</strong>. The project is really about watching an AI
      clear the field, although you too play. This project really helped me dive
      deeper into Python and game development, especially in understanding how
      an AI can make smart moves.

      &emsp;Remember those arcade space shooters? That's what inspired me to
      create
      <strong>The Nightflier</strong>. Initially, I pieced it together in
      Scratch MIT and later brought it to the web through a tool I found online
      (I don't really remember what it was that I used right now). It's a simple
      game where you protect your ship from attackers till the clock runs down.
      It was a really fun project!

    <p>
      &emsp;<strong>Free Roam</strong> takes me back to my high school times
      when I was big on creating games. It started as an ambitious project with
      a grand storyline, but I eventually narrowed it down to this endless
      runner game. The concept? Simple. Just keep your vehicle going. It's a
      little piece from my early days in game development, and I'm pretty fond
      of it.
