      &emsp;When I was grappling with the tedious task of populating databases
      for testing purposes, I thought, "There's got to be a better way!" And
      that's how <strong>DataForge</strong> came to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;It's a Python tool I built to auto-generate and insert realistic
      test data into databases. What's cool about it is how it figures out those
      tricky foreign key relations all by itself. I've had a great time making
      data insertion a breeze with this project! Though, there are some work
      left still to making this project perfect.

    <p>
      &emsp;I've always been fascinated by AI, so I challenged myself to create
      an AI opponent in a classic Tic Tac Toe game. Enter
      <strong>TicTacToeAI</strong>, where I experimented with the Minimax
      algorithm. This project was part of my learning journey in CS50AI from
      Harvard CS50, and it's amazing how much I learned about AI strategies and
      Python programming through it.

    <p>
      &emsp;After TicTacToeAI, I wanted to take a step further. So, I built
      <strong>MinesweeperAI</strong>. It's not just about avoiding mines; it's
      about watching an AI navigate the field. This project really helped me
      dive deeper into Python and game development, especially in understanding
      how an AI can make smart moves.

    <p>
      &emsp;Remember those arcade space shooters? That's what inspired me to
      create
      <strong>The Nightflier</strong>. Initially, I pieced it together in
      Scratch and later brought it to the web. It's a simple game where you
      protect your ship from attackers till the clock runs down. I really
      enjoyed playing around with the shooting mechanics and the strategy of
      moving by shooting in reverse!

    <p>
      &emsp;<strong>Free Roam</strong> takes me back to my high school times
      when I was big on creating games. It started as an ambitious project with
      a grand storyline, but I eventually narrowed it down to this endless
      runner game. The concept? Simple. Just keep your vehicle going. It's a
      little piece from my early days in game development, and I'm pretty fond
      of it.
