			This was the <strong>Mini-project</strong> I had submitted for my
			btech degree, this project led me to be fairly confident in app
			development and I learned a lot about the process of developing an
			app. The app was developed with the intention of one day releasing
			it as an entrepreneurship venture, but who knows what the future
			holds.

		<p>
			&emsp; Comes from the words "Health" and "Genie",
			<strong>Healie</strong> is a personal health assistant that we built
			for a Hackathon, the project actually went on to win
			<b>"Best AI/ML project"</b> in the competition. It's supposed to
			work like a health assistant that you can upload your health
			diagnosis and test data into, from where it would provide a
			secondary opinion regarding your treatments, we thought such a
			project would be important because medical misdiagnosis happen all
			the time.
		</p>

		<p>
			&emsp; Tldr; The project helps doctors in making better choices and
			patients in being better educated of their treatments and medicines.

		<p>
			&emsp;When I was doing the tedious task of populating databases for
			testing an API I wrote, I thought, "There's got to be a better way!"
			And that's how <strong>DataForge</strong> came to life.
		</p>
		<p>
			&emsp;It's a Python tool I built to auto-generate and insert
			realistic test data into databases. What's cool about it is how it
			figures out those foreign key relations to order those tables to
			fill first. I've had a great time making data insertion a breeze
			with this project! Hope you find it helpful too.

			It's a simple game where you protect your ship from attackers till
			the clock runs down. It was a really fun project!
